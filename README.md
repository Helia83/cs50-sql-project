# Customer-Bank Database System

Final SQL project submitted for **CS50** by **Heliasadat Mohammadi**.

This project models a simplified banking system using a relational database.  
It supports managing:
- Customer and branch details
- Deposit accounts
- Loan records

 Data integrity is enforced using foreign keys and constraints.  
 Indexes are used to optimize query performance.

## Structure
- `schema.sql`: Defines tables (`customer`, `branch`, `deposit`, `borrow`)
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries to interact with the database
- `DESIGN.md`: Design rationale, ER diagram, and system overview
